        <p>
          <span className="font-medium">How Do They Work?</span> You can stack points endlessly before the $SUDO token launches, or spend them now to grab WLs, rare items, and chaos boosters inside this marketplace.

        <p>
          <span className="font-medium">Be Strategic.</span> Some will burn early for WL glory. Others will hoard and convert to $SUDO. The choice is yours â€” but either way, it's all degen-coded.
